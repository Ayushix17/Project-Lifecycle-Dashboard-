📊 Project Lifecycle Analytics Dashboard

I'll create a comprehensive Project Lifecycle Analytics Dashboard in Python using Streamlit for the web interface and various data visualization libraries. This dashboard will monitor project health metrics and provide stakeholder insights.

🚀 Overview
This dashboard simulates a Project Lifecycle Management System and provides:

📈 KPI Monitoring: Tracks budget, progress, risk levels, and health scores

⚠️ Risk Analysis: Early warning system for budget overruns and delays

👥 Stakeholder Feedback Insights: Visual sentiment trends across project categories

💰 Cost Utilization Visuals: Compare budget vs spending with interactive plots

⏱️ Timeline Health: Detect delays and analyze project timelines

📋 Detailed Project View: Drill-down into individual project health

🛠️ Tech Stack:
1. Python

2. Streamlit (UI)

3. Plotly Express / Graph Objects (visualizations)

4. Pandas / NumPy (data wrangling)

5. Datetime / Random (data simulation)
